final project ideas!

trying something different, as in an interactive portfolio!

IDEAS:
    Some sort of public dashboard. This is something i'd be using everyday after graduation. 
    The goal is to help keep me motivated and to hold myself accountable.
    If I access user accounts, this could be kindof like a ACA grad social media?
    Instead of wasting time scrolling through facebook, scroll through stories about tech in mediium, 
    or watch videos from youtube on tech right in one space, and keep up with old classmates?
      
      API Ideas:
        --api could be from some practice site to inspire me to code more?
        --medium api to show stories on javascript.
        --youtube to watch tutorials.
        --eventbrite api to see all aca events!
        --api to generate random greetings, so i can make my jumbotron change greetings! haha how fun.
      DB Ideas: 
        --create database with interview questinos to register through adn populate one a day! Randomizer!
