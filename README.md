final project ideas!

trying something different, as in an interactive portfolio!

IDEAS:
    Some sort of personal dashboard. This is something i'd be using everyday after graduation. 
    The goal is to help keep me motivated and to hold myself accountable.
    If I access user accounts, this could be kindof like a ACA grad social media?
    Instead of wasting time scrolling through facebook, scroll through stories about tech in mediium, 
    or watch videos from youtube on tech right in one space, and keep up with old classmates?
      
      API Ideas:
        --api could be from some practice site to inspire me to code more?
        --spotify/pandora api to start up my fav tunes to code to.
        --weather api in current location, to let me know if I can code outside or not.
        --medium api to show stories on javascript.
        --youtube to watch tutorials.
        --google trend api to populate stats on javascript?
