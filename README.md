final project ideas!

trying something different, as in an interactive portfolio!

IDEAS:
    Some sort of public dashboard. This is something we'd be using everyday after graduation. 
    The goal is to help keep students motivated, stay in the loop and to practice more.
    Instead of wasting time scrolling through facebook, scroll through stories about tech in mediium, 
    or watch videos from youtube on tech right in one space, and keep up with old classmates?
      
      API Ideas:
        --api could be from some practice site to inspire me to code more?
        --medium api to show stories on javascript.
        --youtube to watch tutorials.
        --eventbrite api to see all aca events!
        --api to generate random greetings, so i can make my jumbotron change greetings! haha how fun.
      DB Ideas: 
        --create database with interview questinos to register through adn populate one a day! Randomizer!
